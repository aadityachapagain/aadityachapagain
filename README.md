### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aaditya chapagain an AI, Neuroscience enthisiast and DeepLearning practitioner.

<!--
**aadityachapagain/aadityachapagain** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational model simulation of word discovery and signal segmentation inside human temporal lobe, I think which might revolutionize Acoustic model in fields of deep learning. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fundamental concepts of speech Recognition system and word discovery mechanism of human brain.
- ðŸ“« I would love to connect with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaditya-chapagain-b5170a104/)
